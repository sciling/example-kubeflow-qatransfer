			<RelCText>For family with 2 child; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary. Further you can take 3000 monthly living expense and 2000 for conveyance. Additionally any medical requirements. Now its upto you to decide...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Aamirjaved's calculation is somewhat on the high side. I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000. For the schooling; if you are an Asian; it is not that costly to my understanding. As such; my view is that if you are an Asian; grab the offer; but if you are a westerner; kick it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We can't say if it's a good deal - you don't include details of the role. Try to get schooling included in the package. Agree with aamirjaved. Depends on what standard of living you want. Depending on area; you may need 10k+ for a nice 2 bed.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I will suggest to go for unfurnished property; it will cost you around QR 4000-4800 depends on locality; Asian school with transportation for two kids 1000 X2= QR 2000; QR 2000 for living expense and QR 500 for transport; Total cost of living would be QR 8500 - 9300; You can save QR +10500; But it totally depends on your living standard.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Because there are not too much specialty stores that caters only professional cameras (DSLRs). Mostly camera stores can be found only in malls but they are not specialty stores. You know how mall owners jack-up prices of goods; especially if it comes or imported outside Doha. If you have friends in UAE; you can ask them to buy you one and just shipped it you. Or; there are some people selling DLSRs here in QL. You can search the classified ad here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well the salary seem to be good; but if you are bring your family then house of 2BK without furnish and good lcoation would not cost you less then 4000 qr. then furnuiture and basic requirement that shall shoot upto 10K. So indirect 5k per month would be the rent. then car if you go for high end car apprx starting from 100000 to 123000 then monthy EMI would be between 4000 to 4500. then food and other expensies..Now it is totallly depend on how you spend it dude.

			<RelCText>It depends on your living standard and expectation for savings.

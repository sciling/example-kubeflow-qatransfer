Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.

A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable.

Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it.

They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 36, "text": "ideal strings"}, {"answer_start": 36, "text": "ideal strings that are massless"}, {"answer_start": 36, "text": "ideal strings that are massless"}, {"answer_start": 36, "text": "ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable"}], "question": "What can be used to model tension forces?", "id": "57379ed81c456719005744d5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 141, "text": "ideal pulleys"}, {"answer_start": 141, "text": "ideal pulleys"}, {"answer_start": 141, "text": "ideal pulleys"}, {"answer_start": 141, "text": "ideal pulleys"}], "question": "What do you use to let idea strings switch direction?", "id": "57379ed81c456719005744d6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 269, "text": "action-reaction pairs"}, {"answer_start": 250, "text": "instantaneously in action-reaction pairs"}, {"answer_start": 266, "text": "in action-reaction pairs"}, {"answer_start": 250, "text": "instantaneously in action-reaction pairs"}], "question": "In what way do idea strings transmit tesion forces?", "id": "57379ed81c456719005744d7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 997, "text": "conservation of mechanical energy"}, {"answer_start": 997, "text": "conservation of mechanical energy"}, {"answer_start": 623, "text": "the tension force on a load can be multiplied"}, {"answer_start": 627, "text": "tension force on a load can be multiplied"}], "question": "What is the final effect of adding more and more idea strings to a load?", "id": "57379ed81c456719005744d8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 606, "text": "movable pulleys"}, {"answer_start": 507, "text": "connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys,"}, {"answer_start": 674, "text": "every string"}, {"answer_start": 507, "text": "connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys"}], "question": "What can increase the tension force on a load?", "id": "57379ed81c456719005744d9"}]}, {"context": "Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects.
